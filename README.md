This application will cover "Web Development".  

# Functionality/Who is it for?
* In this application, the user creates a field size (ex: 2x2, 3x4, etc.) and can add a limited list of plants/crops to each square plot. You can view each plant individually before adding which will show details like how long it will take to be fully grown, benefits from it pair growing with other plants and etc. Additionally, each field created has settings for the user to set the soil type, climate, environment and/or weather to give best accurate guidance for growing the specific plant.
* Whether you are a farmer, gardener, or even just someone new to cultivating, this website will help guide you to efficiently grow many different kinds of plants/crops.  
* Many farmers or gardeners write their notes by hand on each plant that they grow and can be harder to organize all the different notes or not easy to access these notes anywhere at any time.  
* Not only does it help with users who are experienced with cultivating, but it will also help users who are new to growing their plants as it will provide tips and guide the user with step-by-step instructions.
